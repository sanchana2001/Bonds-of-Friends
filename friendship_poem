In the garden of life, where moments bloom,
A friendship's seed was gently sown,
With laughter's sunlight and kindness' rain,
A beautiful bond began to be known.

Through fields of joy and valleys of tears,

*****************AMEY KOLSE MADE IN INDIA *********Side by side, we walked the way,************

HELLOOO CONFLICT CREATED
Side by side, we walked the way,

A steadfast presence, a listening ear,
In the symphony of life, you'll forever stay.

-----------added lines------------------
Through trials and triumphs, hand in hand,
We've woven a tapestry, rich and true,
A bond that time and distance can't break,
A friendship that's eternally sewn through.

   ----------best friend------------
Like stars that twinkle in the midnight sky,
You light my path, and wipe each tear I cry.

Happy Independence Day....!

In darkness and chaos, he takes a stand,
A savior with an unwavering hand.
Through trials and pain, he prevails,
A protector whose legend never pales.
